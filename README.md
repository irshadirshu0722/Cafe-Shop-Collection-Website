Technologies Used
-----
Our website leverages the power of Python to deliver a seamless experience to users. We've divided the project into two main components:

Frontend (Python File 1)
---
The frontend is responsible for rendering web pages and handling user interactions. It's the face of our website, providing an attractive and intuitive interface. Key functionalities include user cafe submission and search requests that trigger API calls to the backend.

Backend (Python File 2)
---
The backend serves as the brains behind the operation. When the frontend sends an API request, the backend processes it, retrieves the necessary data, and returns it to the frontend. It's responsible for managing the database, cafe listings, and handling search queries efficiently.
